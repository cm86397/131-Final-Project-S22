# Introduction

 The purpose of this project is to generate a model that will predict the average points per game an NBA player will make. I am using data from the 2020 - 2021 regular NBA season. 

## What is the NBA?

The NBA is an abbreviation for the National Basketball Association. It is a professional men's basketball league in North America. The league consists of 30 teams. 

A regular basketball season runs from October to April, with playoffs extending into June.

A 2-pointer is a shot that is scored anywhere inside of the arc. A 3-pointer is a shot made anywhere outside of the arc. Foul shots from the free-throw line count for 1 point. 

## Basketball Positions

There are 5 players from each team on the court during a game. There will usually be a combination of the following positions: 

* **Center (C)** - On offense, the center tries to score on close shots and rebounds. On Defense, the center blocks opponents' shots and rebounds. Usually the tallest and strongest player on the team. 

* **Center Forward (CF)** - Players who play or have played both forward and center on a consistent basis

* **Forward (F)** - Forwards are able to play both inside the paint and outside of it on offense and should be aggressive and rebound-minded on defense.

* **Power Forward (F-C)** - The power forward does many of the things a center does, playing near the basket while rebounding and defending taller players. But power forwards also take longer shots than centers.

* **Shooting Guard (F-G)** - The shooting guard is usually the teamâ€™s best shooter. The shooting guard can make shots from long distance and also is a good dribbler.

* **Point Guard (G)** - Usually the best dribbler and passer, the point guard defends the opponent's point guard and tries to steal the ball

* **Guard Forward (G-F)** - A combination between a forward and shooting guard


## Rundown of Basketball Statistics

Here are a list of statistics that I will be referencing in my project


* **Games Played** ```gp```  - Total number of games a player has played for the season

* **Minutes Per Game** ```mpg``` - The average number of minutes a player has played per game

* **Minutes Percentage** ```min_percentage``` - Percentage of team minutes used by a player while he was on the floor

* **Usage Percentage** ```usg``` - The percentage of team plays used by a player when they are on 

* **Turnover Rate** ```to_percentage``` - A metric that estimates the number of turnovers a player commits per 100 possessions 

* **Free Throws Attempted** ```fta``` -  The number of free throws that a player has attempted

* **Free Throw Percentage** ```ft_percentage``` - The percentage of free throw attempts that a player has made successfully

* **2 Point Field Goals Attempted** ```x2pa``` - The number of two pointers that a player has attempted

* **2 Point Field Goals** ```x2p_percentage``` - The percentage of points scored by a player that are from 2 point field goals

* **3 Point Field Goals Attempted** ```x3pa``` - The number of 3 point field goals that a player has attempted

* **3 Point Field Goals** ```x3p_percentage``` - The percentage of points scored by a player that are from 3 point field goals

* **Effective Field Goal Percentage** ```e_fg``` - Measures field goal percentage adjusting for made 3-point field goals being 1.5 times more valuable than made 2-point field goals.

* **True Shooting Percentage ** ```ts_percent``` - A shooting percentage that factors in the value of three-point field goals and free throws in addition to conventional two-point field goals

* **Rebounds Per Game** ```rpg``` - The number of rebounds a player makes per game

* **Total Rebound Percentage** ```trb_percent``` - The estimated percentage of available rebounds grabbed by the player while the player is on the court 

*  **Assists Per Game** ```apg```- The average number of assists a player makes per game

* **Assist Percentage** ```ast_percentage``` - The estimated percentage of teammate field goals a player assisted while the player is on the court

* **Steals Per Game** ```spg``` - The average number of steals a player makes per game

* **Blocks Per Game** ```bpg``` - The average number of blocks a player makes per game

* **Turnovers Per Game** ```topg```  - The average number of turnovers a player makes per game, it is when a team loses possession of the ball to the opposing team

* **Versatility Index **```vi_versatility```- A metric that measures a player's ability to produce in points, assists, and rebounds. The average player will score around a 5 on the index, while top players score above a 10

* **Offensive Rating** ```ortg_offensive``` - The number of points produced by a player per 100 total individual possessions

* **Defensive Rating** ```drtg_defensive``` - The number of points the player allowed per 100 possessions he individually faced while staying on the court 

In addition to the statistics mentioned above, I will also be using the following variables in my report:
* ```age``` : The age of the player

* ```pos``` - The position that of the player (F, G, C-F, F, F-C, F-G, G, G-F)

I will not be using the team, as I do not think it is relevant. 

# Data Cleaning

- Cleaning the names and loading the data set: 

```{r}
# loading and cleaning data set
basketball_codebook <- read.csv("/Users/calebmazariegos/Desktop/2020 - 2021 Basketball Data Set - Sheet1.csv")

basketball_codebook <- clean_names(basketball_codebook)

```



- Removing unnecessary variables and displaying the first 3 observations: 
```{r}
options(width = 100)

basketball_codebook <- basketball_codebook %>%
  select(-team, -full_name)

head(basketball_codebook, n = 3)
```
- Setting ```pos``` as a factor:
```{r}
basketball_codebook$pos <- as.factor(basketball_codebook$pos)
```

# Exploratory Data Analysis

The exploratory data analysis is based on 626 observations. Each observation represents a single NBA player from the 2020 - 2021 season. 

## Correlation between variables

removing non-numeric variables and variables with NA correlation to clean up plot:

```{r}
# removing non-numeric variables and variables with NA values
basketball_codebook_continuous <- basketball_codebook %>%
  select(-pos, -drtg_defensive, -e_fg, -ortg_offensive, -to_percentage, -ts_percent)
M = cor(basketball_codebook_continuous)
corrplot(M, method = "color", order = "alphabet")
```

## Distribution of continuous variables 

I saved the histogram as a jpeg because the plot did not fit all of the histograms correctly

```{r, message= FALSE}
df1 <- basketball_codebook[,c('age','gp','mpg', 'min_percentage', 'usg', 'to_percentage', 'fta', 'ft_percentage', 'x2pa', 'x2p_percentage', 'x3pa', 'x3p_percentage', 'e_fg', 'ts_percent', 'ppg',  'rpg')]

jpeg(file = "saving_plot1.jpeg")
hist.data.frame(df1, main = "Histograms of all Continuous Variables")
dev.off()
```

![ ](/Users/calebmazariegos/Desktop/saving_plot1.jpeg)

Now it is easy to see which variables are skewed left, skewed right, and which ones have normal and uniform distributions. 

## Histogram of average Points Per Game

Let's take a closer look at the distribution of the average points per game:

```{r}
hist(basketball_codebook$ppg, main = "Histogram of average Points Per Game", xlab = "Points Per Game (PPG)", col = "#4287f5",
     xlim = c(0,35), breaks = 25)
```

There is a rightward skew, this means that most players tend to score around 3 - 7 points per game. 


## Position
I hypothesize that the position of the player affects how many points per game the player will average because some positions might be better suited to shooting goals. I will break this down further by looking into how the position of the player affects how many points per game they score:

```{r}
ggplot(basketball_codebook, aes(ppg)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, color = "black", fill = "#28753d") +
  facet_wrap(~pos, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(
    title = "Histogram of PPG by position"
  ) +  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```
```{r}
ggplot(basketball_codebook, aes(reorder(pos, ppg), ppg)) +
  geom_boxplot(varwidth = TRUE, color = "red", fill = "white") + 
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = "Position by PPG",
    x = "Position"
  ) + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

It looks like most positions have the same average, which is between 5 - 10 goals. Point Guards (G) and Forwards tend to have the most outliers (F). As expected, Shooting Guards (F-G) have the highest average.

Now, let's examine how the number of games played impacts the average number of minutes per game. 

```{r, message = FALSE}
ggplot(basketball_codebook, aes(mpg, ppg, colour = pos)) + labs(x = "Minutes Per Game (mpg)", y = "Points Per Game (ppg)", title = "PPG vs MPG") +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = "red", size = 2) +geom_point()

```

The relationship between Minutes Per Game ```mpg``` and ```points per game``` seems to be positive. This means that if the player has a higher average minutes per game, they will likely have more points per game. This makes sense since they will have more time on the court to have a chance to shoot.

## 3-pointers vs 2-pointers

```{r}
library(scales)
c1 <- rgb(80, 35, 204,max = 255, alpha = 80, names = "lt.blue")
c2 <- rgb(230, 223, 28, max = 255, alpha = 80, names = "lt.pink")
hgA <- hist(basketball_codebook$x2p_percentage, breaks = 20,plot = FALSE)
hgB <- hist(basketball_codebook$x3p_percentage, breaks = 20,plot = FALSE)

plot(hgA, col = c2, ylim = c(0,200), main = "Histogram of 2P% and 3P%", xlab = "Percentage of Success", xlim = (0:1))
plot(hgB, col = c1, add = TRUE)


legend("topright", c("2P%", "3P%"), fill=c(c2, c1))
```

```{r}
boxplot(basketball_codebook$x2p_percentage, basketball_codebook$x3p_percentage, col = c(c2, c1), names = c("2 Pointers", "3 Pointers"), ylab = "Percent of Shots Made", main = "Boxplot of 2P% and 3P%")
```


It appears that 2 point field goals seem to have a higher percentage of success. There also appears to be some outliers of high point accuracy which may be explained by only being in a small amount of games. I will explore this further by looking at shot accuracy and number of games played. 

```{r}
ggplot(basketball_codebook, aes(gp, x2p_percentage)) + geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = "purple", size = 2)+ labs(title = "% of 2 Pointer Shots Made vs Games Played", x = "Games Played",  y= "% of 2 Pointer Shots Made")+geom_point(color = "#FFD700")
```
```{r}
ggplot(basketball_codebook, aes(gp, x3p_percentage)) + geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = "gold", size = 3)+ labs(title = "% of 3 Pointer Shots Made vs Games Played", x = "Games Played", y= "% of 3 Pointer Shots Made")+geom_point(color = "purple")
```

When it comes to 2 Point field goals made, it looks like most of the outliers can be attributed to the low number of games played. After about 20 games played, the percentage of shots made seems to taper between 0.3 - 0.6.

Since 3 point field goals are more difficult to score, it makes sense that there are players with 0% 3 pointers scored, even with 40+ games played. This distribution is not as clean as the 2 Point field goals. 

## Relationship between Assists, Blocks, Steals, Rebounds and Points per Game

ggplot(basketball_codebook, aes(apg, spg))+
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = "red", size = 2) +geom_point()
```{r}
ggplot(basketball_codebook, aes(apg, ppg, color = pos))+
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = "red", size = 2) + labs(title = "Assists per Game vs Points Per Game", x = "Assists per Game", y = "Points per Game") + geom_point()
```
```{r}
ggplot(basketball_codebook, aes(bpg, ppg, color = pos))+
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = "red", size = 2) + labs(title = "Blocks per Game vs Points Per Game", x = "Blocks per Game", y = "Points per Game")+geom_point()
```
```{r}
ggplot(basketball_codebook, aes(spg, ppg, color = pos))+
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = "red", size = 2) + labs(title = "Steals per Game vs Points Per Game", x = "Steals per Game", y = "Points per Game")+ geom_point()
```
```{r}
ggplot(basketball_codebook, aes(rpg, ppg, color = pos))+
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, color = "red", size = 2) + labs(title = "Rebounds per Game vs Points Per Game", x = "Rebounds per Game", y = "Points per Game")+ geom_point()
```


For Assists, Steals, and Rebounds, there seems to be a positive relationship with how many points per game the player scores. There does not seem to be a very obvious correlation with Blocks, but it does appear that Point Guards tend to have less blocks per game, but the most points per game. 


# Data Split

The data was split in a 70% training and 30% testing split. 

```{r}
set.seed(123)
basketball_split <- basketball_codebook %>%
  initial_split(prop = 0.7, strata = "ppg")

basketball_train <- training(basketball_split)
basketball_test <- testing(basketball_split)
```

The training data set has about 440 observations and the testing data set has about 185. 


# Model Building

## Creating a recipe
We want to create a recipe to represent the model we are fitting

```{r}
basketball_recipe <- recipe(ppg ~ pos + age + gp + mpg + min_percentage + usg + to_percentage + fta + ft_percentage + x2pa + x2p_percentage + x3pa + x3p_percentage + e_fg + ts_percent + rpg + trb_percent + apg + ast_percentage + spg + bpg + topg + vi_versatility + ortg_offensive + drtg_defensive, data = basketball_train) %>%
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) %>%
  step_scale(all_predictors()) %>%
  step_normalize(all_predictors()) %>%
  step_novel(all_nominal_predictors()) %>%
  step_nzv(all_nominal_predictors())

```

## Folds
Stratified cross-validation with 10 folds and 5 repeats: 
```{r}
basketball_folds <- vfold_cv(basketball_train, strata = ppg, v = 10, repeats = 5)
```

### Ridge Regression

Specifying the model type and engine:

```{r}
ridge_spec <- linear_reg(penalty = tune(), mixture = 0) %>%
  set_mode("regression") %>%
  set_engine("glmnet")
```


Setting up the workflow: 

```{r}
ridge_workflow <- workflow() %>%
  add_recipe(basketball_recipe) %>%
  add_model(ridge_spec)
```

Creating a grid with the values of penalty that we are trying:

```{r}
set.seed(24)

penalty_grid <- grid_regular(penalty(range = c(1, 11)), levels = 50)
penalty_grid

tune_res <- tune_grid(
  ridge_workflow,
  resamples = basketball_folds)
tune_res
```

Creating a visualization of the output of ```tune_grid()```:
```{r}
autoplot(tune_res)
```

Seeing the raw metrics:

```{r}
collect_metrics(tune_res)
```

Selecting the best values:

```{r}
best_penalty <- select_best(tune_res, metric = "rsq")
best_penalty
```

Fitting the best model using the whole training data set:

```{r}
ridge_final <- finalize_workflow(ridge_workflow, best_penalty)
ridge_final_fit <- fit(ridge_final, data = basketball_train)
```

Predict on testing set, and showing a visualization:
```{r}
basketball_train_res1 <- predict(ridge_final_fit, new_data = basketball_test %>% dplyr::select(-ppg))
basketball_train_res1 <- bind_cols(basketball_train_res1, basketball_test %>% dplyr::select(ppg))
basketball_train_res1 %>%
  head()

basketball_train_res1 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=.pred, y =ppg)) + geom_point(alpha=1) + geom_abline(lty = 2) + coord_obs_pred()

augment(ridge_final_fit, new_data = basketball_test) %>%
  rsq(truth = ppg, estimate = .pred)
```

### Regression Trees

Creating a general decision tree specification using ```rpart``` as the engine
```{r}
tree_spec <- decision_tree() %>%
  set_engine("rpart")
```

Regression decision tree engine:
```{r}
reg_tree_spec <- tree_spec %>%
  set_mode("regression")
```

Tuning ```cost_complexity``` to find the best performing decision tree
```{r, message=FALSE}
reg_tree_wf <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(reg_tree_spec %>% set_args(cost_complexity = tune())) %>%
  add_recipe(basketball_recipe)

set.seed(124)
param_grid <- grid_regular(cost_complexity(range = c(-10,10)), levels = 100)

tune_res_tree <- tune_grid(
  reg_tree_wf,
  resamples = basketball_folds,
  grid = param_grid
)

autoplot(tune_res_tree)
```
Collecting the metrics:
```{r}
tree_roc_auc <- collect_metrics(tune_res_tree) %>%
  arrange(-mean)

head(tree_roc_auc)
```
Selecting the best-performing model according to ```rmse``` and fitting the final model on the whole training data set:

```{r}
best_complexity <- select_best(tune_res_tree, metric = "rmse")

reg_tree_final <- finalize_workflow(reg_tree_wf, best_complexity)

reg_tree_final_fit <- fit(reg_tree_final, data = basketball_train)
```

Visualizing the model:
```{r, warning=FALSE}
reg_tree_final_fit %>%
  extract_fit_engine() %>%
  rpart.plot()
```

Predict on testing set, showing a visualization, and checking the performance on the testing data set:
```{r}
basketball_train_res2 <- predict(reg_tree_final_fit, new_data = basketball_test %>% dplyr:: select(-ppg))
basketball_train_res2 <- bind_cols(basketball_train_res2, basketball_test %>% dplyr::select(ppg))
tail(basketball_train_res2)

basketball_train_res2 %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = .pred, y = ppg)) + geom_point(alpha = 1) + geom_abline(lty = 2) + coord_obs_pred()

augment(reg_tree_final_fit, new_data = basketball_test) %>%
  rmse(truth = ppg, estimate = .pred)
```

### Random Forest
```{r}
rf_spec <- rand_forest(mtry = 8) %>%
  set_engine("randomForest", importance = TRUE) %>%
  set_mode("regression")
```






```{r}
urlPackage <- "https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/randomForest/randomForest_4.6-12.tar.gz"

install.packages(urlPackage, repos=NULL, type="source") 
```

Fitting the model:
```{r}
library(urlPackage)
rf_fit <- fit(rf_spec, ppg ~., data = basketball_train)
```


### Lasso Regression
